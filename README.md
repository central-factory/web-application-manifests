# Web Application Manifests

A repository with Web Application manifests for many common websites. The files follows the [Web Application Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/) specification but include an `additionalProperties` object with some values being used to extend functionalities


## Icons

Icons are mostly specified as svg and marked with a relative url (eg. `assets/simple-icons/evernote.svg`) so the application can internally resolve the icon without pointing to an external url.
The applications use the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) packages.
